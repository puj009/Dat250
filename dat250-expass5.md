# Dat250: Software Technology Experiment 5

### The Tutorials
* Experiment 1: No problems. 
* Experiment 2: Had some problems cloning the repository, so I just added it to the same repository as experiment 1 
and copied in all the files needed.
* Experiment 3: I just added this to the same repository as well. There were no problems. 
* Experiment 4: No problems.
