# Dat250: Software Technology Experiment 7

### Technical problems during tutorial
There were only some minor problems with where to place the different packages. 
After trying different things I think I worked it out because it now runs. 

### Link to code
Decided to place all of the experiments in one repository. 
[All of the experiments](https://github.com/puj009/Hello_World_rabbitmq)

### Pending issues
I am not able to run the program in my terminal. It only works in the Intellij terminal.
