#### The CURD operations for experiment 1:
Before all of that I did the **Getting Started** tutorial which made the database I was to use for the CURD operations. 

Here are the CURD operations:
* Create:Here I inserted many values into the **inventory** database.

* Read: Here I queried the **inventory** database with different conditions.

#### Experiment 2
I completed the tutorial, and the screenshot is of a map-reduce operation on the **orders** collection using three
functions from the tutorial. There is also a query to verify the results.

Here is the database that was created:

### My Map-reduce
For my map-reduce function I looked at what day (order day) got the most sales (high price) in the **orders** database. 
It can be useful to look at what day people order the most to maybe help the sales of the items. 
Here are my commands:
